Certainly! Let's break down the provided React code:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  // Using the useState hook to create a state variable named "color"
  // and a function to update it named "setColor". The initial value is "olive".
  const [color, setColor] = useState("olive");

  // The return statement contains the JSX code for rendering the component.
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen duration-200" style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>
      {/* A fixed position container at the bottom of the screen */}
      <div className="fixed flex flex-wrap justify-center bottom-12 inset-x-0 px-2">
        {/* A flex container with wrapping for buttons */}
        <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-3 shadow-lg bg-white px-3 py-2 rounded-3xl">
          {/* Button to change color to red */}
          <button
            onClick={() => setColor("red")}
            className="outline-none px-4 py-1 rounded-full text-white shadow-lg"
            style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }}
          >
            Red
          </button>
          {/* Button to change color to green */}
          <button
            onClick={() => setColor("green")}
            className="outline-none px-4 py-1 rounded-full text-white shadow-lg"
            style={{ backgroundColor: "green" }}
          >
            Green
          </button>
          {/* Button to change color to blue */}
          <button
            onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
            className="outline-none px-4 py-1 rounded-full text-white shadow-lg"
            style={{ backgroundColor: "blue" }}
          >
            Blue
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Explanation:

1. `useState`: This is a React hook that allows functional components to manage state. In this case, 
it's used to create a state variable called `color` and a function called `setColor` to update that state. 
The initial state of `color` is set to "olive".

2. The component `App`: This is a functional component named `App` that renders the UI. Inside the component, 
we have JSX code describing the structure of the UI.

3. JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
 In this JSX code:
   - `<div className="w-full h-screen duration-200" style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>`: This `<div>`
    element takes up the full width and height of the screen and its background color is determined by the `color` 
    state variable.
   - Inside the `<div>`, there's another `<div>` with the class `fixed flex flex-wrap justify-center bottom-12 inset-x-0 px-2`.
    This positions its child elements fixed at the bottom of the screen.
   - Inside the fixed `<div>`, there's another `<div>` that contains three buttons for changing the background color.
    These buttons are styled using Tailwind CSS classes and inline styles. They also have `onClick` event handlers that call the `setColor` function with different colors when clicked.

4. `export default App;`: This exports the `App` component as the default export from the file, allowing it to be
 imported and used in other parts of the application.

Overall, this code creates a simple React component that displays a full-screen container with a dynamic background color. There are also buttons fixed at the bottom of the screen that allow the user to change the background color by clicking on them.
